# Low Level Implementation of Malloc() and Free() using Linked List

## Project Overview

In this project, I implemented my very own malloc and free functions in C. If you are not familiar with the function, malloc() is used to request memory space in the heap and free() is to make the space available again. 

I used linked list as my data structure and keeps track of the free space in the memory and allocate appropriate amount of memory from the space whenever new memory space is requested.
